# The Book of Native

This book documents the internals of the **native** UI library — from the build system and core architecture to drawing, font rendering, and platform integration.

If you haven’t already, read the [README](../../README.md) first for an overview of what `native` is and what problems it solves.

## Chapters

1. [Getting Started](getting-started.md)  
   How to build `native`, its structure, toolkits, and how to run examples.

2. [Build System](build-system.md)  
   Toolkit detection, per-platform source inclusion, and CMake practices.

3. [Design Patterns](patterns.md)  
   Core architectural patterns: platform-class separation, event model, etc.
